AWS Certified Advanced Networking - Specialty (ANS-C01) Exam Guide

Domain 1: Network Design
Task Statement 1.1: Design a solution that incorporates edge network services to
optimize user performance and traffic management for global architectures.
Knowledge of:

- [ ] Design patterns for the usage of content distribution networks (for
example, Amazon CloudFront)
- [ ] Design patterns for global traffic management (for example, AWS Global
Accelerator)
- [ ] Integration patterns for content distribution networks and global traffic
management with other services (for example, Elastic Load Balancing [ELB],
Amazon API Gateway)

Skills in:
- [ ] Evaluating requirements of global inbound and outbound traffic from the
internet to design an appropriate content distribution solution

Task Statement 1.2: Design DNS solutions that meet public, private, and hybrid
requirements.
Knowledge of:

- [ ] DNS protocol (for example, DNS records, TTL, DNSSEC, DNS delegation,
zones)
- [ ] DNS logging and monitoring
- [ ] Amazon Route 53 features (for example, alias records, traffic policies,
resolvers, health checks)
- [ ] Integration of Route 53 with other AWS networking services (for example,
Amazon VPC)
- [ ] Integration of Route 53 with hybrid, multi-account, and multi-Region
options
- [ ] Domain registration

Skills in:
- [ ] Using Route 53 public hosted zones
- [ ] Using Route 53 private hosted zones
- [ ] Using Route 53 Resolver endpoints in hybrid and AWS architectures
- [ ] Using Route 53 for global traffic management
- [ ] Creating and managing domain registrations
- [ ] 
Task Statement 1.3: Design solutions that integrate load balancing to meet high
availability, scalability, and security requirements.
Knowledge of:
- [ ] How load balancing works at layer 3, layer 4, and layer 7 of the OSI model
- [ ] Different types of load balancers and how they meet requirements for
network design, high availability, and security
- [ ] Connectivity patterns that apply to load balancing based on the use case
(for example, internal load balancers, external load balancers)
- [ ] Scaling factors for load balancers
- [ ] Integrations of load balancers and other AWS services (for example, Global
Accelerator, CloudFront, AWS WAF, Route 53, Amazon Elastic Kubernetes
Service [Amazon EKS], AWS Certificate Manager [ACM])
- [ ] Configuration options for load balancers (for example, proxy protocol,
cross-zone load balancing, session affinity [sticky sessions], routing
algorithms)
- [ ] Configuration options for load balancer target groups (for example, TCP,
GENEVE, IP compared with instance)
- [ ] AWS Load Balancer Controller for Kubernetes clusters
- [ ] Considerations for encryption and authentication with load balancers (for
example, TLS termination, TLS passthrough)

Skills in:
- [ ] Selecting an appropriate load balancer based on the use case
- [ ] Integrating auto scaling with load balancing solutions
- [ ]  Integrating load balancers with existing application deployments

Task Statement 1.4: Define logging and monitoring requirements across AWS and
hybrid networks.

Knowledge of:
- [ ] Amazon CloudWatch metrics, agents, logs, alarms, dashboards, and insights
in AWS architectures to provide visibility
- [ ] AWS Transit Gateway Network Manager in architectures to provide visibility
- [ ] VPC Reachability Analyzer in architectures to provide visibility
- [ ] Flow logs and traffic mirroring in architectures to provide visibility
- [ ] Access logging (for example, load balancers, CloudFront)

Skills in:
- [ ] Identifying the logging and monitoring requirements
- [ ] Recommending appropriate metrics to provide visibility of the network
status
- [ ] Capturing baseline network performance
