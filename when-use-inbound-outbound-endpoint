## Inbound Endpoint
Example: On-Premises to AWS DNS Resolution

Scenario: You have on-premises servers that need to resolve domain names for resources hosted in your AWS VPCs.

- [ ] Create an Inbound Endpoint: This endpoint allows DNS queries from on-premises servers to be resolved by the Route 53 Resolver in your VPC.
- [ ] Configure On-Premises DNS Server: Update your on-premises DNS server to forward queries for specific domains (e.g., *.aws.internal) to the inbound endpoint's IP address.
```bash
Steps:

Create an Amazon Route 53 Resolver inbound endpoint in the central VPC.
Update your on-premises DNS server to forward queries to the IP address of the inbound endpoint.
When an on-premises server needs to resolve a domain name for an AWS resource, it sends the query to the on-premises DNS server.
The on-premises DNS server forwards the query to the inbound endpoint.
The inbound endpoint resolves the query using the Route 53 Resolver and returns the answer to the on-premises DNS server, which then forwards it to the original requester.
```
## Outbound Endpoint
Example: AWS to External (On-Premises) DNS Resolution

Scenario: You have AWS resources that need to resolve domain names for resources hosted in your on-premises data centers.

- [ ] Create an Outbound Endpoint: This endpoint allows DNS queries from AWS resources to be forwarded to external DNS servers (e.g., on-premises DNS servers).
- [ ] Configure Route 53 Resolver Rules: Set up rules to forward queries for specific domains (e.g., *.onprem.internal) to the on-premises DNS servers via the outbound endpoint.
```bash
Steps:

Create an Amazon Route 53 Resolver outbound endpoint in the central VPC.
Create Route 53 Resolver rules to forward queries for the on-premises domain to the outbound endpoint.
Configure the BIND DNS servers (or update DHCP options set in your VPC) to use the outbound endpoint for name resolution of specific domains.
When an AWS resource needs to resolve a domain name for an on-premises resource, it sends the query to the BIND DNS server.
The BIND DNS server forwards the query to the outbound endpoint.
The outbound endpoint forwards the query to the on-premises DNS server.
The on-premises DNS server resolves the query and returns the answer to the outbound endpoint, which then forwards it back to the AWS resource.
```
